This project serves as the backend API for a sample todo application, built using Express.js, TypeScript, TypeORM, and PostgreSQL. It provides a robust foundation for managing todo items, including creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion.

Technologies:

    Express.js: A lightweight and flexible Node.js web framework for building APIs.
    TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for improved code maintainability and reliability.
    TypeORM: An object-relational mapper (ORM) that simplifies database interactions with automatic schema generation and data manipulation.
    PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its reliability and advanced features.

Installation:

    Clone this repository.
    Install dependencies: npm install
    Create a .env file and configure database connection details.
    Set up a PostgreSQL database.

Running the Application:

    Start the development server: npm run dev (or yarn dev)
    The API will be available on the specified port (default: 3000).

Features:

    CRUD Operations for Todos:
        Create new todo items
        Retrieve existing todo items (all or by ID)
        Update existing todo items
        Delete todo items
    Type Safety with TypeScript: Enhances code reliability and maintainability.
    Database Interactions with TypeORM: Provides a clean abstraction layer for database access.
    Environment Variables: Keeps sensitive configuration separate from code.
    Error Handling Middleware: Improves API robustness by gracefully handling errors.

Customize and Extend:

This is a foundational backend for a todo application. You can customize and extend it by:

    Implementing authentication and authorization.
    Adding additional features like due dates, priorities, and categories.
    Integrating with other services for push notifications or collaboration.
